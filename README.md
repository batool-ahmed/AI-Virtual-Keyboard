# AI Virtual Keyboard

This is a simple Virtual Keyboard:
- in QWERTY Format
- with alphabet keys (in uppercase) + special characters (; , .) + backspace key (b)
- using finger gestures and positions to hover, click and type text
- with a text bar to display text
- with the ability to also write on other open text apps or browser

# Language and Libraries:
- The Main Language used was Python
- The libraries and modules used were cvzone, open-cv, mediapipe, time, and pynput

## To run this:
- You need a code editor and a Python Interpreter
- Running main.py using the above two will display your virtual
- To end the program, you will need to interrupt it by pressing

## Future Work:
- Ability to repeat a character consecutive
- Adjust time latency between clicks
- Add more characters and keys
- Add the ability to switch between lower and upper case
- Add a command to end the program
- Optimize the code
- Make its UI aesthetic
- Make it more User-friendly and adhesive to UX principles
